This is a small side project where I'm tried to recreate the basics of one of my favourite childhood games, **Bad Ice Cream** , where you can try and play it here : https://www.nitrome.com/html5-games/badicecream/

I tried to implement the bare minimum : 
- WASD mouvement 
- Firing ice in all directions 
- Breaking Ice (WIP)
